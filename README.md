# The-Impact-of-COVID-19-on-the-Adoption-of-Telehealth-Over-Time

#### Background and Rationale:

Before the COVID-19 pandemic, telehealth, or the delivery of healthcare services through digital platforms and telecommunications, was a relatively niche area in healthcare, often limited to specialized services. Several barriers hindered its widespread adoption, including limited insurance reimbursement, outdated regulations, and inadequate infrastructure, especially in rural or underserved areas.
However, the COVID-19 pandemic acted as a catalyst for rapid integration and adoption of telehealth services. Faced with the need for social distancing and reducing in-person contact, healthcare systems across the globe adopted telemedicine on an unprecedented scale. In the U.S., telehealth usage surged from a mere 0.3% of healthcare visits in 2019 to over 53% by April 2020, as emergency regulatory relaxations were introduced to meet the surge in demand (Bashshur et al., 2020).
Despite this surge, disparities in telehealth adoption persisted, with geographic, socioeconomic, and demographic factors playing a role. For example, rural areas and lower-income populations often faced challenges such as poor internet access, limited technological literacy, and lack of infrastructure. Even after the pandemic, the rate of telehealth adoption stabilized at around 21.5%-25%, indicating its potential as an adjunct to traditional healthcare, but not a complete replacement.

This project aims to examine how telehealth adoption evolved over the course of the pandemic, identify the demographic and geographic disparities in adoption, and provide insights on the future of telehealth integration.

### Objective and Research Questions:

This project seeks to explore the trajectory of telehealth adoption during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on the following questions:
How did telehealth usage evolve before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic? What geographic and demographic patterns characterized telehealth adoption over time?

#### Data Description: 

The dataset for this project is sourced from a Medicare Telehealth Trends Report (2024), which includes records on telemedicine usage across various demographic and geographic categories. The dataset includes:
Size: Approximately 15,000 rows of data. Key Columns: Time_Frame_Yr: The year or period (e.g., 2020, 2021, Entire Period). TM_Srvc_Type: The type of telemedicine service (e.g., E-Visit, Virtual Check-In, Telehealth). Bene_Geo_Desc: The geographic region (e.g., states, national, territories). TM_Bene_Cnt: The count of beneficiaries using telemedicine. TM_Bene_Pct: Percentage of beneficiaries utilizing telemedicine. The dataset is relevant because it captures critical information on the volume of telehealth usage, trends over time, and key factors influencing adoption.

Through this project, we aim to derive the following insights:

* Temporal Trends: Understand how telehealth usage increased during the pandemic and its stabilization post-pandemic.
* Geographic and Demographic Patterns: Analyze which regions and demographic groups had the highest and lowest adoption rates. 

#### Storyline:
The analysis will flow as follows:
* Demographic Trends: We will first explore how telemedicine adoption varied by demographics, including age, sex, and socioeconomic status.
* Temporal Analysis: We will then examine how the usage of telemedicine changed over time, focusing on the impact of the pandemic.
* Geographic Trends: Following that, we will look into how telehealth adoption differed across geographic locations, focusing on rural versus urban areas.
